# Robot Autonomy | Labs

This repository contains code and instructions for running labs for the 16-662 Robot Autonomy class.

## Docker Installation

Docker is required for running robot control code from your personal computers.
For the class we'll only support running Docker on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04.

If you have a Mac or Windows 10 Pro (not Home), everything should still work as expected.

To install Docker:
- On Linux, run `bash docker/install_docker_linux.sh`
- On Windows, follows [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- On Mac, follows [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
